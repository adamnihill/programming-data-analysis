# Programming for Data Analysis Practical Assignment
This Jupyter notebook explores the numpy.random package based on the instructions found [here](https://github.com/brianmcginley/ProgDA/raw/master/ProgDA_Assignment.pdf). The aim of the notebook is to explore and explain the numpy.random package in a clear and easy to understand manner. Each function used in this notebook will contain a link to it's section in the official numpy.random [tutorial](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.14.0/reference/routines.random.html) as well as links to any external sources used.

# Required Software

## Required Python Packages
- [Numpy](https://numpy.org/)
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)

# Summary of Assignment
The notebook is divided into four sections corresponding to the assignment instructions. 

## Section 1
This section explores simple random data. The majority of functions in this section of the numpy.random tutorial return random samples in the uniform distribution. However, one function, numpy.random.randn, returns samples in the standard normal distribution. As such, there are examples here demonstrating both distributions and the differences between them. 

## Section 2 
This section explores the permutation functions of numpy.random. To demonstrate the use of these functions, a practical example of a music player's shuffle feature was described.

## Section 3
This section explores five specific distributions of the numpy.random package.

These distributions are:
- The Geometric Distribution
- The Poisson Distribution
- The Triangular Distribution
- The Standard_t Distribution
- The Hypergeometric Distribution

Each distribution is accompanied by a ractical example of how it may be applied.

## Section 4
This section explores the use of seeds in generating pseudorandom numbers
